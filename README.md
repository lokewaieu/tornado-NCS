# tornado-NCS
This hobby project uses the base project of gudovskiy's tinyYOLO Object Detection (https://github.com/gudovskiy/yoloNCS) (Special Thanks!)

We have integrated his object detection to a simple Tornado Websocket, whereby when a desired object is detected, an image of it will be captured and pushed to a localhost for display.

** Still a work in progress, intend to also implement car plate detection in the future to work side by side with the object detection **
