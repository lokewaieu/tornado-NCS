# tornado-NCS
This project incorporates gudovskiy's tinyYOLO Object Detection (https://github.com/gudovskiy/yoloNCS) (Special Thanks!)

We have integrated his object detection to a simple Tornado Websocket, whereby when a desired object is detected, an image of it will be captured and pushed to a localhost for display.
